PROMPT START
Build a high-end, conversion-focused single-page website for a professional cleaning service company using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This part focuses only on the frontend: layout, styling, responsiveness, and UI interactions. No backend.
1. Project Setup
Create three files:
index.html
styles.css
script.js
Link styles.css and script.js properly from index.html.
Use semantic HTML5 and clean, commented code.
2. Global Design System
Use a premium, modern style that looks like a $2,000 custom website.
Font: Google Font "Poppins" or "Inter".
Colors (use CSS variables):
--color-bg: #F8FAFC; (off-white)
--color-primary: #0F172A; (dark navy)
--color-accent: #22C55E; (fresh green) or #38BDF8 (aqua)
--color-text: #0B1120;
--color-muted: #64748B;
Style:
Lots of white space, clean layout, rounded corners.
Use box-shadow for cards, and smooth hover transitions.
Fully responsive, mobile-first.
Use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layouts.
3. Business Info (Placeholders)
Use these placeholders (make them easy to change in the HTML):
Business Name: “PrimeShine Cleaning Co.”
Location: Tampa, Florida
Phone: (555) 123-4567

4. Page Structure (Sections)
Create a single page with these sections:

On mobile:
Replace links with a hamburger icon.
Use JavaScript to open/close a slide-down mobile menu.
4.2 Hero Section
Full-width hero at the top.
Background image (use a generic cleaning-related placeholder URL in CSS).
Add a dark overlay so text is readable.
Content centered vertically:
Big headline:
“Spotless Spaces. Stress-Free Living.”
Subheadline:
“Professional residential and commercial cleaning in Tampa with flexible plans and 5-star service.”
Two buttons:
Primary: “Get a Free Quote” → scrolls to Contact section.

Add smooth fade-in animation for hero text on page load.
On mobile, add a floating “Get a Free Quote” button in the bottom-right corner.
4.3 Trust Bar / Highlights Strip
Section under hero.
Horizontal strip with 3–4 items like:
“5+ Years Experience”

JavaScript: Create a simple slider for testimonials (auto-rotate + controls).
4.8 FAQ Section
Title: “Frequently Asked Questions”.
6–8 questions, each with:
Question heading
Hidden answer that expands.
Use accordion behavior (click question to toggle answer) with JS.
4.9 Contact / Booking Section
Section with two-column layout on desktop:

Short text: “Ready for a spotless home or office?”
Phone, email, service area (Tampa, nearby areas).

4.10 Footer
Include:
Logo / brand name: “PrimeShine Cleaning Co.”
Phone, email, location
Small navigation links: Home, Services, Pricing, Contact
Copyright text with current year
“Back to top” link that scrolls smoothly.
5. JavaScript Interactions (script.js)
Implement these frontend-only behaviors:
Smooth Scrolling
All nav links, “Get a Free Quote”, “View Services”, “Back to Top”, and “Book Now” buttons scroll smoothly to their target sections.
Mobile Menu Toggle
Hamburger icon opens/closes a mobile menu with a simple animation (add/remove CSS class).
Service Details Modal
For each “Learn More” button in the Services section:
Open a modal overlay with additional text about that service.
Modal includes a close icon or button.
Clicking outside the modal or on close → closes it.
Pricing → Preselect Service
When a “Book Now” button is clicked:
Smooth scroll to Contact section.
In the form, automatically set the Service Type or a hidden input to that plan name (e.g. “Premium VIP Plan”).
FAQ Accordion
Clicking a question toggles its answer.
Only one open at a time on desktop (optional); on mobile multiple open is okay.
Testimonials Slider
Auto-rotate testimonials every 6–8 seconds.
Include next/prev buttons or dots for manual control.
Basic Form Validation (Frontend Only)
On submit:
Check required fields (name, phone, email, service type).
Check email format.
If invalid: show inline errors and prevent “fake submit”.
If valid: prevent real submit, clear form, and show a temporary success message (e.g., a green banner saying:
“Thanks! We’ll contact you within 24 hours.”).
6. Animations & Polish
Use CSS classes + JS to create scroll reveal effects:
When a section enters the viewport, fade/slide it in.
Add hover effects on:
Buttons (slight scale + shadow)
Cards (raise slightly with shadow).
Make sure layout feels premium on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Deliver all frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS) complete and ready to run in the browser.
